    <h4>Challeges:</h4>
    <p>I had a great deal of trouble navigating GitHub and coordinating transfers between its repositories, my own documents, and the server. It was unclear to me even how to view my webpage as it was being developed.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>The HTML code itself was quite easy; that much I already knew. However, I was shown first hand how complicated it can be to navigate through the many directories and environments in order to get all the files into the right spot. In particular, I learned that I cannot see my HTML in action if the file is in the server directory. I have to copy it out into my documents to do so.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I was having a semi-major freak out until I got help from a friend from high school who helped sort all of this out for me. We sat down in his dorm and he explained to me what it meant for this file to be in that directory and what I can and cannot do with the file if it is in a certain spot. Thanks, Jason!</p>

    <h3>Assignment 0: 09/25/16</h3>
    <h4>Challeges:</h4>
    <p>I had a great deal of trouble navigating GitHub and coordinating transfers between its 
       repositories, my own documents, and the server. It was unclear to me even how to view my 
       webpage as it was being developed.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>The HTML code itself was quite easy; that much I already knew. However, I was shown first 
       hand how complicated it can be to navigate through the many directories and environments in 
       order to get all the files into the right spot. In particular, I learned that I cannot see 
       my HTML in action if the file is in the server directory. I have to copy it out into my 
       documents to do so.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I was having a semi-major freak out until I got help from a friend from high school who 
       helped sort all of this out for me. We sat down in his dorm and he explained to me what it 
       meant for this file to be in that directory and what I can and cannot do with the file if it 
       is in a certain spot. Thanks, Jason!</p>

    <h3>Assignment 1: 10/06/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>One of the major challenges I had on this project was in getting the 'X' to sit in the right 
       spot on the ToDoIt notes. I had to run a few google searches to figure out exactly how to do 
       it but I did. It required using two selectors in one CSS function, for want of a better word. 
       My next big issue was that I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the footer 
       to stick to the bottom. It turns out I had it all right except that I needed to set the 
       position of the 'html' selector to relative and the min-height to 100%.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>In the course of completing this project, I learned CSS from the ground up. I knew nothing
       before Thursday the 29th of September when I sat down and read those tutorials. This was 
       supplemented, of course, by the information given in class. My biggest takeaway from the 
       assignment is a good one: I very capable of, and even relish, teaching myself how to program
       using the resources available to me. I am sure this will be an excellent quality going 
       forward.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I basically taught myself CSS on the first day after this assignment was posted using 
       primarily <a href="www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, a online tutorial site. Also, I must
       credit my classmate Albert Morgan with revealing the final critical piece to the footer 
       puzzle. The content of our subsequent lectures were very informative, covering the same 
       content that I had found myself but in a way that made it clear what the expectations were
       in terms of good form and practice.</p>
    <h4>Google searches?</h4>
    <p>I googled <strong>a lot</strong> of things, including but by no means limited to <em>"what is 
       the difference between absolute and fixed positioning css"</em> and <em>"how to change the 
       pointer appearance css"</em>. As mentioned previously, I made a concerted effort to test the
       limits of what I could teach myself using the world wide web as a resource.</p>

    <h3>Assignmnet 2: 10/22/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>I found it challenging to figure out the nuances of querySelector, but once I did this 
       assignment was easy. I think a great deal about which algorithmic choices will make my program 
       run the most efficiently and this assignment was a great exercise in largely letting go of 
       that and simply getting a product that works first; thereafter I went back through and 
       streamlined it. It sounds like no big deal but my normal process involves stressing over such 
       things even as I'm writing the first draft of my code.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>I knew no JavaScript whatsoever before we started this unit, so learning all of those 
       functions was a fresh experience. It is, however, similar enough to C based languages that I 
       still felt at home as I developed my code.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I spent a great deal of time on Stack Overflow and W3Schools.</p>
    <h4>Google searches?</h4>
    <p>Two of my searches were: <em>"get text component of paragraph javascript"</em> and <em>
       "querySelector"</em>, the latter of the two being purposefully vague. I wanted to start at
       the beginning since I was so confused at first.</p>

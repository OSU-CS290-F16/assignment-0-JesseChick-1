    <h3>Assignment 0: 09/25/16</h3>
    <h4>Challeges:</h4>
    <p>I had a great deal of trouble navigating GitHub and coordinating transfers between its
       repositories, my own documents, and the server. It was unclear to me even how to view my
       webpage as it was being developed.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>The HTML code itself was quite easy; that much I already knew. However, I was shown first
       hand how complicated it can be to navigate through the many directories and environments in
       order to get all the files into the right spot. In particular, I learned that I cannot see
       my HTML in action if the file is in the server directory. I have to copy it out into my
       documents to do so.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I was having a semi-major freak out until I got help from a friend from high school who
       helped sort all of this out for me. We sat down in his dorm and he explained to me what it
       meant for this file to be in that directory and what I can and cannot do with the file if it
       is in a certain spot. Thanks, Jason!</p>

    <h3>Assignment 1: 10/06/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>One of the major challenges I had on this project was in getting the 'X' to sit in the right
       spot on the ToDoIt notes. I had to run a few google searches to figure out exactly how to do
       it but I did. It required using two selectors in one CSS function, for want of a better word.
       My next big issue was that I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the footer
       to stick to the bottom. It turns out I had it all right except that I needed to set the
       position of the 'html' selector to relative and the min-height to 100%.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>In the course of completing this project, I learned CSS from the ground up. I knew nothing
       before Thursday the 29th of September when I sat down and read those tutorials. This was
       supplemented, of course, by the information given in class. My biggest takeaway from the
       assignment is a good one: I very capable of, and even relish, teaching myself how to program
       using the resources available to me. I am sure this will be an excellent quality going
       forward.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I basically taught myself CSS on the first day after this assignment was posted using
       primarily <a href="www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, a online tutorial site. Also, I must
       credit my classmate Albert Morgan with revealing the final critical piece to the footer
       puzzle. The content of our subsequent lectures were very informative, covering the same
       content that I had found myself but in a way that made it clear what the expectations were
       in terms of good form and practice.</p>
    <h4>Google searches?</h4>
    <p>I googled <strong>a lot</strong> of things, including but by no means limited to <em>"what is
       the difference between absolute and fixed positioning css"</em> and <em>"how to change the
       pointer appearance css"</em>. As mentioned previously, I made a concerted effort to test the
       limits of what I could teach myself using the world wide web as a resource.</p>

    <h3>Assignmnet 2: 10/22/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>I found it challenging to figure out the nuances of querySelector, but once I did this
       assignment was easy. I think a great deal about which algorithmic choices will make my program
       run the most efficiently and this assignment was a great exercise in largely letting go of
       that and simply getting a product that works first; thereafter I went back through and
       streamlined it. It sounds like no big deal but my normal process involves stressing over such
       things even as I'm writing the first draft of my code.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>I knew no JavaScript whatsoever before we started this unit, so learning all of those
       functions was a fresh experience. It is, however, similar enough to C based languages that I
       still felt at home as I developed my code.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I spent a great deal of time on Stack Overflow and W3Schools.</p>
    <h4>Google searches?</h4>
    <p>Two of my searches were: <em>"get text component of paragraph javascript"</em> and <em>
       "querySelector"</em>, the latter of the two being purposefully vague. I wanted to start at
       the beginning since I was so confused at first.</p>

    <h3>Assignmnet 3: 11/8/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>I had no clue what a server even was before starting this assignment and so the toughest part
       was just conceptualizing the serving of documents based on user command. Aside from that, I
       struggled to implement the conditional logic needed to serve the proper combination and style
       of content.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>I knew just about nothing other than the javascript syntax. I learned the hierarchy of the
       various files and what needs to be done in order to serve the proper file at the proper time
       with the proper styling.</p>
    <h4>Resource:s</h4>
    <p>I used stack overflow a lot in order to find out how to include all of the styling and dynamic
       elements. I also worked with a classmate a little to get the "Content-type" working properly.</p>
    <h4>Google searches?</h4>
    <p>Several variations on <em>"add style and dynamic content to html page node server"</em> and
       <em>"what are the options for Content-type node js,"</em> both of which turned up at least
       moderately useful results.</p>

   <h3>Assignmnet 4: 11/27/16</h3>
   <h4>Challenges:</h4>
   <p>Most of the challenges in this lab were the result of me being inattentive or lazy. I was
      I was unable to access the attributes of each of the people in the json file because I was
      indexing by name ("Luke Skywalker" rather than "luke"), a problem which I would have found
      a good deal earlier if I had used console.log() more frequently. The only other issue
      I had was figuring out exactly what serving "statically" means, which I is something I feel
      I should know by now out of reflex, but I guess not. In the end I just used fs to read the
      files once, cache their content, then serve that with the status code, but I kept my initial
      code just so that whoever is evaluating me knows I can do both.</p>
   <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
   <p>As previously mentioned, I learned beyond doubt that console.log() is my friend and I should
      use it liberally whenever I am doing any server work. I already knew the javascript involed
      in serving the contents of the todo notes, but that was about it. As with all of the
      assignments, I felt that there was a pretty big learning curve.</p>
   <h4>Resources:</h4>
   <p>I used fewer resources on this assignment than I have on any previous. I did, however, partner
      up with a classmate who was having similar difficulty and combine smarts to sort out the
      aforementioned routing difficulty.</p>
   <h4>Google searches?</h4>
   <p><em>"install express handlebars npm"</em> and <em>"pass arguments to handlebars file"</em></p>

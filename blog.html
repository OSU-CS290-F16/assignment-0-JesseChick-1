    <h3>Assignment 0: 09/25/16</h3>
    <h4>Challeges:</h4>
    <p>I had a great deal of trouble navigating GitHub and coordinating transfers between its 
       repositories, my own documents, and the server. It was unclear to me even how to view my 
       webpage as it was being developed.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>The HTML code itself was quite easy; that much I already knew. However, I was shown first 
       hand how complicated it can be to navigate through the many directories and environments in 
       order to get all the files into the right spot. In particular, I learned that I cannot see 
       my HTML in action if the file is in the server directory. I have to copy it out into my 
       documents to do so.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I was having a semi-major freak out until I got help from a friend from high school who 
       helped sort all of this out for me. We sat down in his dorm and he explained to me what it 
       meant for this file to be in that directory and what I can and cannot do with the file if it 
       is in a certain spot. Thanks, Jason!</p>

    <h3>Assignment 1: 10/06/16</h3>
    <h4>Challenges:</h4>
    <p>One of the major challenges I had on this project was in getting the 'X' to sit in the right 
       spot on the ToDoIt notes. I had to run a few google searches to figure out exactly how to do 
       it but I did. It required using two selectors in one CSS function, for want of a better word. 
       My next big issue was that I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the footer 
       to stick to the bottom. It turns out I had it all right except that I needed to set the 
       position of the 'html' selector to relative and the min-height to 100%.</p>
    <h4>What did I learn/already know?</h4>
    <p>In the course of completing this project, I learned CSS from the ground up. I knew nothing
       before Thursday the 29th of September when I sat down and read those tutorials. This was 
       supplemented, of course, by the information given in class. My biggest takeaway from the 
       assignment is a good one: I very capable of, and even relish, teaching myself how to program
       using the resources available to me. I am sure this will be an excellent quality going 
       forward.</p>
    <h4>Resources:</h4>
    <p>I basically taught myself CSS on the first day after this assignment was posted using 
       primarily <a href="www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, a online tutorial site. Also, I must
       credit Mr. Albert Morgan with revealing the final critical piece to the footer puzzle.</p>
